# My very first GitPod site

Welcome to my first GitPod site, created while following the module over at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

## Project details

This project has revisited some basic HTML and CSS that I have learned, as well as taught me how to add, commit and push changes to my project and files to GitHub.
