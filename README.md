# My very first GitPod site

Welcome to my first GitPod site, created while following the module over at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

## Project details

This project has revisited some basic HTML and CSS that I have learned, as well as taught me how to add, commit and push changes to my project and files to GitHub. 

The project includes 3 pages that have various technologies and their respective logos displayed, with a simple navbar to navigate the website.
